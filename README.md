# Map of Cycling Routes by Suitability- Athens, GA
### UGA's Community Mapping Lab in partnership with the BikeAthens group

This map details cycling suitability for the most heavily trafficked streets in Athens, GA. 
Other point data containing information about ACC public transit stops as well as point data for health related services are also included.

This map was created using the qgis2web plugin, within QGIS, which automates the creation of HTML code in order to produce an open-source map. Ultimately, this approach to developing an interactive map for the BikeAthens project was abandoned due to the complexity of creation in conjunction with given time constraints. The final map was produced using ESRI's suite of tools. The final map can be found here: https://bit.ly/Athensbikemap 

Additionally, an interactive app was created using ArcGIS Studio Player. Those who would prefer to access the map using the in-app interface rather than navigating the web-app using the browser can find it by navigating the ArcGIS App Studio online library by searching "BikeAthens".
